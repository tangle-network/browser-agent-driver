# Evolve Progress

## Generation 5 — Open Loop (events + hooks + lazy decisions) — 2026-04-07

Pursuit: `.evolve/pursuits/2026-04-07-open-loop-gen5.md`
Branch: `gen5-open-loop`

### Shipped (24 components across 3 pillars)

**Pillar A — TurnEventBus + Live Observability**
- `src/runner/events.ts` — typed discriminated-union TurnEvent + bounded-retention bus + DistributiveOmit helper
- `src/runner/runner.ts` — phase emission at every boundary (turn-started, observe-start/end, decide-start/end, decide-skipped-cached, decide-skipped-pattern, execute-start/end, verify-start/end, recovery-fired, override-applied, turn-end, run-end)
- `src/cli-view-live.ts` — SSE `/events` endpoint with replay-on-connect + heartbeat + cancel POST
- `src/cli.ts --live` — opens viewer + streams during run + waits for SIGINT after completion

**Pillar B — Extension API for User Customization**
- `src/extensions/types.ts` — `BadExtension` interface, `resolveExtensions`, `rulesForUrl`, type guards
- `src/extensions/loader.ts` — auto-discovers `bad.config.{ts,mts,mjs,js,cjs}` from cwd + `--extension` CLI flag
- `src/brain/index.ts` — `setExtensionRules`, `composeSystemPromptParts` injects user rules per-section + per-domain after the cached prefix
- `src/runner/runner.ts` — subscribes extensions to the bus, applies `mutateDecision` after the override pipeline
- `src/test-runner.ts` — passes `extensions` + `eventBus` through to every BrowserAgent
- `docs/extensions.md` — full user-facing guide with worked examples

**Pillar C — Lazy Decisions (the user's "lazy load even decisions" question)**
- `src/runner/decision-cache.ts` — bounded LRU + TTL, key = SHA1(snapshot + url + goal + lastEffect + budgetBucket), strips volatile telemetry on cache hit
- `src/runner/deterministic-patterns.ts` — cookie-banner-accept matcher + single-button-modal-close matcher; runs BEFORE the LLM
- `src/runner/runner.ts` — wired both as the first two short-circuits in the decide phase; lazy `analyzeRecovery` only fires when there's an error trail

### Tests
- 830 passing (was 758, **+72 net new**)
- New: `runner-events.test.ts` (15), `decision-cache.test.ts` (15), `deterministic-patterns.test.ts` (11), `extensions.test.ts` (24), `cli-view-live.test.ts` (7)

### Tier1 deterministic gate
- Pass rate: **100%** (4/4 — both modes × both scenarios)
- Total cost: $0.49

### Lazy-loading audit (answering Drew's question)

Already lazy: 11 dynamic imports for provider modules, 13+ for subcommand handlers, patchright-vs-playwright, browser launch, snapshot helpers, CDP session, memory layer, vision capture, cursor overlay. Module loading was NOT the lever.

NOT lazy before Gen 5 (now fixed):
- LLM `decide()` was called every turn unconditionally → now skipped on cache hit and on deterministic pattern match
- `analyzeRecovery` ran every turn → now only fires when there's an error trail
- `detectSupervisorSignal` runs even when supervisor is disabled → deferred to Gen 5.1

### What didn't ship (deferred to Gen 5.1)
- Persisting events to `<run-dir>/events.jsonl` via FilesystemSink subscriber
- Inspect mode (click on screenshot → highlight @ref) — needs viewer-side click handler
- Shadow `streamText` for in-flight token display
- Lazy `detectSupervisorSignal` and lazy override pipeline

### Verdict
**ADVANCE.** Three pillars work as a coherent system: extensions + viewer + decision cache all subscribe to the same TurnEventBus. Pass rate maintained at 100%, no regressions, +72 new tests.

## Gen 4 / Evolve Round 1 — Verify infra savings above noise floor — 2026-04-07

**Goal:** Prove or refute Gen 4's per-piece wall-clock wins with statistically significant signal.

**Instrument shift:** Wall-clock tier1 gate (±1556ms pooled stddev) and long-form scenarios (±150s strategic variance) cannot detect 50-300ms infra savings. Pivoted to deterministic micro-bench (`bench/gen4-microbench.ts`) that exercises ONLY the changed code paths against a real Chromium instance.

### Verified deltas (n=20 iterations each, stddev <0.3ms)

| Path | Baseline | Gen 4 | Δ | % |
|------|----------|-------|---|---|
| Cursor overlay click overhead (showCursor=true) | 250.3ms | 8.7ms | **−241.6ms** | **−96.5%** |
| verifyEffect on `click` | 101.1ms | 51.1ms | **−50.0ms** | **−49.5%** |
| verifyEffect on `scroll` | 101.1ms | 0.0ms | **−101.1ms** | **−100%** |
| verifyEffect on `wait` | 101.1ms | 0.0ms | **−101.1ms** | **−100%** |
| verifyEffect on `hover` | 101.1ms | 0.0ms | **−101.1ms** | **−100%** |

**Signal-to-noise ratio:** effect sizes 50-250ms vs measurement stddev 0.3ms = effectively infinite. These are NOT noise — they're deterministic, repeatable, and exactly match the Gen 4 spec.

### Translated to user impact

- **Screen-recording mode (showCursor=true), 50-turn session:** ~12s reclaimed (50 × 240ms cursor overhead removed)
- **Mixed action 20-turn session (~15 verified click/navigate + 5 reads):** ~750ms reclaimed (15 × 50ms + 5 × 100ms = 1250ms total verifyEffect savings)
- **Anthropic provider (untested locally — no key):** 50-150ms TTFT savings per cached turn after turn 1, plus ~$0.0045/turn input cost reduction
- **Cold start (turn 1):** 600-1200ms reclaimed via warmup ping (untested but provider-agnostic)

### Long-form bench scenario

Built `bench/scenarios/cases/local-long-form.json` — a 19-field multi-step form that produces 15-29 turns naturally. **Verdict:** also too noisy for wall-clock comparison (turn count itself varies 15→29 between reps as the agent's strategy changes), but confirmed the new instrumentation hypothesis.

### What worked

- Pivoting from "measure wall clock with LLM in the loop" to "measure changed code paths directly" — produced clean, statistically significant signal in <5 minutes vs 36 minutes of noisy reps.
- bench/gen4-microbench.ts is itself a deliverable — it will catch any future regression of these specific paths deterministically.

### What didn't work

- Long-form scenarios. Made noise WORSE not better. Agent strategic variability (15-29 turns on the same goal) added ±150s on top of LLM call variance.
- Tier1 gate at any rep count for sub-2s infra changes.

### Round 1 verdict

**KEEP** — All 5 measured changes deliver the predicted savings within their target thresholds. Pass rate maintained at 100% on tier1 gate and longform shakeout. Plateau detection: not applicable yet, only round 1.

## Generation 4 — Agent Loop Speed — 2026-04-07 (pursue cycle)

Pursuit: `.evolve/pursuits/2026-04-07-agent-loop-speed-gen4.md`
Branch: `main`

### Shipped
1. Drop unconditional 100ms wait in verifyEffect; replace with conditional 50ms (only for click/navigate/press/select)
2. Speculative observe inside verifyEffect — observe runs in parallel with the 50ms settle wait
3. Skip post-action observe entirely on pure wait/scroll actions (cachedPostState short-circuit)
4. Cursor overlay animation overlap — drop 240ms `waitForTimeout` per click; CSS transition runs alongside the action
5. Provider connection pre-warm via `Brain.warmup()` — fired in parallel with first observe; 1-token ping
6. Anthropic prompt caching markers on CORE_RULES via `SystemModelMessage[]` + `cache_control: ephemeral`
7. `cacheReadInputTokens` / `cacheCreationInputTokens` plumbed through Brain → Turn → reports

### Tests
- 758 tests passing (was 748, +10 new)
- New: `tests/brain-system-cache.test.ts` (5 tests) — cache marker construction, byte-stable prefix
- New: `tests/brain-warmup.test.ts` (5 tests) — CLI provider no-ops, env flag, error swallowing
- Updated: `tests/cursor-overlay.test.ts` — drop CURSOR_ANIMATION_MS test

### Tier1 deterministic gate
- Pass rate: 100% (24/24 across 3 reps × 2 modes × 2 scenarios)
- full-evidence: 18,541ms → 17,972ms (−3.1%, ±1,556ms noise — within noise)
- fast-explore:  16,079ms → 16,527ms (+2.8%, ±1,380ms noise — within noise)
- **Verdict:** statistically neutral at this benchmark granularity. Real wins predicted in Anthropic-keyed runs (cache hit) and longer scenarios where 50-300ms savings × N turns add up.

### Architecture additions (Gen 4)
- `Brain.composeSystemPromptParts()` — splits system prompt into stable + dynamic parts
- `Brain.buildSystemForDecide()` — provider-aware: returns `SystemModelMessage[]` for anthropic, `string` otherwise
- `Brain.warmup()` — best-effort connection pre-warm
- `BrainDecision.cacheReadInputTokens` / `cacheCreationInputTokens` — prompt cache observability
- `Turn.cacheReadInputTokens` / `cacheCreationInputTokens` — surface cache stats per turn

### Next generation seeds (Gen 5)
- Streaming decode with early action commit (`streamText` + incremental JSON parse + parallel locator resolution)
- Long-form bench scenario (20+ turns) so infra savings show above LLM noise floor
- Verify Anthropic cache hit rate on a real Anthropic-keyed run (cacheReadInputTokens > 0 from turn 2)
- OpenAI prompt caching audit — automatic detection, but verify it actually fires on our prompts

## Generation 3 — 2026-04-06

Pursuit: `.evolve/pursuits/2026-04-06-design-audit-gen3.md`

### Shipped
1. ROI scoring on findings — impact, effort, blast, computed roi
2. Cross-page systemic detection — findings on 2+ pages collapse into 1 with blast=system
3. CDP-based axe injection (3-tier fallback for CSP-strict pages)
4. Dynamic per-fragment dimensions — fragments declare custom dimensions, LLM scores them
5. Top Fixes report section — opens every report with ROI-sorted top 5
