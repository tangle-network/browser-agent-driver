# Evolve Progress

## Generation 4 — Agent Loop Speed — 2026-04-07

Pursuit: `.evolve/pursuits/2026-04-07-agent-loop-speed-gen4.md`
Branch: `main`

### Shipped
1. Drop unconditional 100ms wait in verifyEffect; replace with conditional 50ms (only for click/navigate/press/select)
2. Speculative observe inside verifyEffect — observe runs in parallel with the 50ms settle wait
3. Skip post-action observe entirely on pure wait/scroll actions (cachedPostState short-circuit)
4. Cursor overlay animation overlap — drop 240ms `waitForTimeout` per click; CSS transition runs alongside the action
5. Provider connection pre-warm via `Brain.warmup()` — fired in parallel with first observe; 1-token ping
6. Anthropic prompt caching markers on CORE_RULES via `SystemModelMessage[]` + `cache_control: ephemeral`
7. `cacheReadInputTokens` / `cacheCreationInputTokens` plumbed through Brain → Turn → reports

### Tests
- 758 tests passing (was 748, +10 new)
- New: `tests/brain-system-cache.test.ts` (5 tests) — cache marker construction, byte-stable prefix
- New: `tests/brain-warmup.test.ts` (5 tests) — CLI provider no-ops, env flag, error swallowing
- Updated: `tests/cursor-overlay.test.ts` — drop CURSOR_ANIMATION_MS test

### Tier1 deterministic gate
- Pass rate: 100% (24/24 across 3 reps × 2 modes × 2 scenarios)
- full-evidence: 18,541ms → 17,972ms (−3.1%, ±1,556ms noise — within noise)
- fast-explore:  16,079ms → 16,527ms (+2.8%, ±1,380ms noise — within noise)
- **Verdict:** statistically neutral at this benchmark granularity. Real wins predicted in Anthropic-keyed runs (cache hit) and longer scenarios where 50-300ms savings × N turns add up.

### Architecture additions (Gen 4)
- `Brain.composeSystemPromptParts()` — splits system prompt into stable + dynamic parts
- `Brain.buildSystemForDecide()` — provider-aware: returns `SystemModelMessage[]` for anthropic, `string` otherwise
- `Brain.warmup()` — best-effort connection pre-warm
- `BrainDecision.cacheReadInputTokens` / `cacheCreationInputTokens` — prompt cache observability
- `Turn.cacheReadInputTokens` / `cacheCreationInputTokens` — surface cache stats per turn

### Next generation seeds (Gen 5)
- Streaming decode with early action commit (`streamText` + incremental JSON parse + parallel locator resolution)
- Long-form bench scenario (20+ turns) so infra savings show above LLM noise floor
- Verify Anthropic cache hit rate on a real Anthropic-keyed run (cacheReadInputTokens > 0 from turn 2)
- OpenAI prompt caching audit — automatic detection, but verify it actually fires on our prompts

## Generation 3 — Design Audit (archived)

Branch: `design-audit-gen2` (carries both Gen 2 and Gen 3 changes)

## Generation 3 — 2026-04-06

Pursuit: `.evolve/pursuits/2026-04-06-design-audit-gen3.md`

### Shipped
1. ROI scoring on findings — impact, effort, blast, computed roi
2. Cross-page systemic detection — findings on 2+ pages collapse into 1 with blast=system
3. CDP-based axe injection (3-tier fallback for CSP-strict pages)
4. Dynamic per-fragment dimensions — fragments declare custom dimensions, LLM scores them
5. Top Fixes report section — opens every report with ROI-sorted top 5
6. JSON output exposes `topFixes`
7. 28 new unit tests (24 ROI + 4 dimensions)

### Calibration (3 generations)
| Site | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Gen 3 |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| Stripe | 9 | 9 | 9 |
| Apple | 9 | 9 | 9 |
| Linear | 9 | 9 | 9 |
| Anthropic | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| Airbnb | 8 | 8 | 8 |

5/5 preserved across all 3 generations. Gen 3 adds top-fixes ROI ranking,
dynamic dimensions (Stripe gets `trust-signals`, Airbnb gets `conversion`),
and live cross-page systemic detection (verified on 3-page Stripe audit).

### Architecture additions (Gen 3)
- `src/design/audit/roi.ts` — pure-function ROI scoring + cross-page detection (167 lines)
- `tests/design-audit-roi.test.ts` — 24 unit tests
- Extended `RubricFragment.dimension`, `ComposedRubric.dimensions`
- Extended `DesignFinding` with impact/effort/blast/roi/pageCount
- Extended `measure/a11y.ts` with CSP-bypass injection ladder

### Next generation seeds (Gen 4)
- 3-turn pipeline (separate ranking call)
- Reference library with embedded fingerprints
- Live evolve loop validation against a real vibecoded app
