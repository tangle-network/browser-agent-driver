## 0.14.2

### Patch Changes

- [`59b296d`](https://github.com/tangle-network/browser-agent-driver/commit/59b296d470c813940616c7923431eb1cb7899554) Thanks [@drewstone](https://github.com/drewstone)! - Switch npm publish to OIDC trusted publishing. Each release is now authenticated via a short-lived GitHub OIDC token instead of a long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` secret, validated against the trusted publisher configured on npmjs.com. Every publish is cryptographically tied to the exact GitHub commit + workflow run that built it, with provenance attestation visible on the npm package page. Also fixes the `release-tag` script to push the prefixed `browser-agent-driver-v*` tag the existing publish workflow expects, so the next release runs end-to-end with zero manual intervention.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- [`7c8e2cd`](https://github.com/tangle-network/browser-agent-driver/commit/7c8e2cde5197d8b756cb241523a8cd2e96d7d64d) Thanks [@drewstone](https://github.com/drewstone)! - Fix `provider.chat()` routing for OpenAI-compatible endpoints (Z.ai, LiteLLM, vLLM, Together, OpenRouter, Fireworks). `@ai-sdk/openai` v3+ defaults to the OpenAI Responses API which most third-party endpoints don't implement, causing 404s. Both the new `zai-coding-plan` provider and the default `openai` provider now explicitly use the chat-completions path.
